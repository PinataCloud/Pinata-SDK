# Pinata SDK

Official NodeJS SDK for [Pinata](https://pinata.cloud)

## Overview

The Pinata NodeJS SDK provides the quickest / easiest path for interacting with the [Pinata API](https://pinata.cloud/documentation#GettingStarted).

## Installation
```
npm install --save @pinata/sdk
```

## Setup
To start, simply require the Pinata SDK and set up an instance with your Pinata API Keys. Don't know what your keys are? Check out your [Account Page](https://pinata.cloud/account).
```javascript
const pinataSDK = require('@pinata/sdk');
const pinata = pinataSDK('yourPinataApiKey', 'yourPinataSecretApiKey');
```

Quickly test that you can connect to the API with the following call:
```javascript
pinata.testAuthentication().then((result) => {
    //handle successful authentication here
    console.log(result);
}).catch((err) => {
    //handle error here
    console.log(err);
});
```

## Usage
Once you've set up your instance, using the Pinata SDK is easy. Simply call your desired function and handle the results of the promise.

<a name="hashMetadata-anchor"></a>
### `hashMetadata`
Allows the user to change the name and keyvalues associated with content pinned to Pinata.
Changes made via this endpoint only affect the metadata for the hash passed in. [Metadata](#metadata-anchor) is specific to Pinata and does not modify the actual content stored on IPFS in any way. It is simply a convenient way of keeping track of what content you have stored.

##### `pinata.hashMetadata(ipfsPinHash, metadata)`
##### Params
* `ipfsPinHash` - A string for a valid IPFS Hash that you have pinned on Pinata.
* `metadata` A JSON object containing the following:
  * `name` (optional) - A new name that Pinata will associate with this particular hash. 
  * `keyvalues` (optional) - A JSON object with the updated keyvalues you want associated with the hash provided (see more below)
  
###### Adding or modifying keyvalues
To add or modify existing keyvalues, simply provide them in the following format for the keyvalues object:
```
keyvalues: {
    newKey: 'newValue', //this adds a keyvalue pair
    existingKey: 'newValue' //this modifies the value of an existing key if that key already exists
}
```

###### Removing keyvalues
To remove a keyvalue pair, simply provide null as the value for an existing key like so:
```
keyvalues: {
    existingKeyToRemove: null //this removes a keyvalue pair
}
```

#### Response
If the operation is successful, you will receive back an "OK" REST 200 status.

##### Example Code
```javascript
const metadata = {
    name: 'new custom name',
    keyvalues: {
        newKey: 'newValue',
        existingKey: 'newValue',
        existingKeyToRemove: null
    }
};
pinata.hashMetadata('yourHashHere', metadata).then((result) => {
    //handle results here
    console.log(result);
}).catch((err) => {
    //handle error here
    console.log(err);
});
```


<a name="hashPinPolicy-anchor"></a>
### `hashPinPolicy`
Allows the user to change the pin policy for an individual piece of content.
Changes made via this endpoint only affect the content for the hash passed in. They do not affect a user's account level pin policy.

To read more about pin policies, please check out the [Regions and Replications Documentation](https://pinata.cloud/documentation#RegionsAndReplications).

##### `pinata.hashPinPolicy(ipfsPinHash, newPinPolicy)`
##### Params
* `ipfsPinHash` - A string for a valid IPFS Hash that you have pinned on Pinata.
* `newPinPolicy` A JSON object with a new [Pin Policy](#pinPolicies-anchor) for the hash.

#### Response
If the operation is successful, you will receive back an "OK" REST 200 status.

##### Example Code
```javascript
const newPinPolicy = {
    regions: [
            {
                id: 'FRA1',
                desiredReplicationCount: 2
            },
            {
                id: 'NYC1',
                desiredReplicationCount: 2
            }
        ]
    }
};
pinata.hashPinPolicy('yourHashHere', newPinPolicy).then((result) => {
    //handle results here
    console.log(result);
}).catch((err) => {
    //handle error here
    console.log(err);
});
```

The response for this call will the total combined size of everything you currently have pinned on pinata.
This value will be expressed in bytes

##### Example Code
```javascript
pinata.userPinnedDataTotal().then((result) => {
    //handle results here
    console.log(result);
}).catch((err) => {
    //handle error here
    console.log(err);
});
```

## Host Node Multiaddresses
For endpoints that involve Pinata finding and pinning content that already resides on the IPFS network, you can help Pinata find your content faster by optionally providing us with the "multiaddresses" up to five host nodes that your content already resides on.

To find the multiaddresses of your nodes, simply run the following on your node's command line:
```
ipfs id
```
In the response, you'll want to focus on the "Addresses" array that's returned. Here you'll find the multiaddresses of your node. These multiaddresses are what other IPFS nodes use to connect to your node.

In the "Addresses" array, take note of the multiaddress that contains your external IP address. Not the local ipv4 "127.0.0.1" address or the local ipv6 "::1" address.

Here's an example of what a full external ipv4 multiaddress would look like (your IP address and node ID will differ):

`/ip4/123.456.78.90/tcp/4001/ipfs/QmAbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUvWxYzAbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQr`

⚠️ Please make sure every node provided is online. Pinata will attempt to connect to all nodes before pinning the content, and if any these nodes are offline, your request will eventually fail.

## Pin Policies
A pin policy tells Pinata how many times content should be replicated, and where that content should be replicated at.

To read more about pin policies, please check out the [Regions and Replications Documentation](https://pinata.cloud/documentation#RegionsAndReplications).

Pin policies take the following form:

  
##### Example pin policy object
```
{
    regions: [
        {
            id: 'FRA1',
            desiredReplicationCount: 1
        },
        {
            id: 'NYC1',
            desiredReplicationCount: 2
        }
    ]
}
```
The ids of currently available public regions are:

• FRA1 - Frankfurt, Germany (max 2 replications)

• NYC1 - New York City, USA (max 2 replications)

## Pinata Metadata
For endpoints that allow you to add content, Pinata lets you add optionally metadata for that content. This metadata can later be used for querying on what you've pinned with our [userPinList](#userPinList-anchor) endpoint. Providing metadata does not alter your content or how it is stored on IPFS in any way.

The metadata object can consist of the following values:
* name (optional) - A custom string to use as the name for your content
* keyvalues (optional) - An object containing up to 10 custom key / value pairs. The values can be:
  * strings
  * numbers (integers or decimals)
  * dates (provided in ISO_8601 format)
  
##### Example metadata object
```
{
    name: "customName",
    keyvalues: {
        customKey: "customValue",
        customKey2: "customValue2"
    }
}
```

## Pinata Options
Some endpoints allow you to pass additional options for Pinata to take into account when adding content to IPFS.

The options object can consist of the following values:
* cidVerson (optional) - The [CID version](https://github.com/multiformats/cid#versions) IPFS will use when creating a hash for your content. Valid options are:
  * `0` - CIDv0
  * `1` - CIDv1
* wrapWithDirectory (optional) - Tells IPFS to wrap your content in a directory to preserve the content's original name. See [this blog post](https://flyingzumwalt.gitbooks.io/decentralized-web-primer/content/files-on-ipfs/lessons/wrap-directories-around-content.html) for more details on what this does. Valid options are:
  * `true`
  * `false`
* customPinPolicy (optional) - a custom [Pin Policy](#pinPolicies-anchor) for the piece of content being pinned. Providing a custom pin policy as part of a request means that the content being pinned will be replicated differently from the user's default pin policy found under the [Account](https://pinata.cloud/account) page.

  
##### Example pinataOptions object
```
{
    cidVersion: 1,
    wrapWithDirectory: true,
    customPinPolicy: {
        regions: [
            {
                id: 'FRA1',
                desiredReplicationCount: 2
            },
            {
                id: 'NYC1',
                desiredReplicationCount: 2
            }
        ]
    }
}
```
